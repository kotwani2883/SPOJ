 * Only write code when you are sure of the approach .Remember of penalties!!
 * Do optimized thinking (Think which technique/observation can be used,deep drive into the problem!!).
 * Do post analysis after the contest./Upsolving is much more important than giving contest
 * Learn a technique and solve some problems if its new to you--->Solve as many as problems to be confident in those kinds of problem!!
 * DON'T GET STUCK ON ONE APPROACH,Move your mind in all directions
 *Remember who you are and your Capabilities!!
